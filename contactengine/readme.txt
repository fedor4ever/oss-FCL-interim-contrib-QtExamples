John Kern is writing this up. It is very much work in progress. It will be moved
to the public wiki when it is reasonability complete. You can find it here

Wish list
This is simply a list of possible interesting ideas to implement.

* Get the users picture from facebook.
* Get the linkedIn profile. Users might want to review it before
visiting with someone who they haven't seen in awhile.
* dynamically determine if it is a touch or non-touch device.
* beef up QStackedView to associated the options menu with the page in questions.
