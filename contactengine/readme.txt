John Kern is writing this up. It is very much work in progress. It will be moved
to the public wiki when it is reasonability complete. You can find it here

Wish list
This is simply a list of possible interesting ideas to implement.



Ian McDonald
* Phone app doesn't need to connect to a custom server, but to Google directly
* Phone app should have connector plugins so if you want to write a plugin for Hotmail, Exchange etc you can
* Phone app should be able to launch call, email, SMS, Skype etc (each a plugin)
* Desktop app should be much the same and Qt is great as Linux, Windows, Mac and can we even aim for the same codebase?
* Maybe we should tie it into KDE PIM especially now this has gone mobile? http://dot.kde.org/2010/06/10/kde-pim-goes-mobile
* Given above, do we even need a web server/web page
* Can we make it all opensource hosted at Github or similar so that other firms using Symbian and Google Apps have a solution

* Get the users picture from facebook.
* Get the linkedIn profile. Users might want to review it before visiting with someone who they haven't seen in awhile.
* dynamically determine if it is a touch or non-touch device.
* beef up QStackedView to associated the options menu with the page in questions.
